            <h3>The dictionary definition: Third Eye</h3>
            <p><u>Hinduism</u> - The “eye of insight” located in the forehead, which can be activated through the practice of yoga. Also seen as the locus of occult power and wisdom in the forehead of a deity, especially the god Shiva. </p>
            <p><u>Ancient Egypt</u> - Symbol of protection, royal power and good health</p>
            <p>A little bit of divine magic never hurt anyone ;)</p>
            <h3>The objective:</h3>
            <p>Align ourselves energetically & master our minds to reach a state of complete awareness.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Pursuing the Third Eye</h3>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span>– The flawed & reductive chain of perception</p>
            The Third Eye is commonly thought of as a higher sense, which perceives & reveals truth — an aperture which cuts through illusion & unveils things as they are.
            <p>Now that begs the question: are the 5 ordinary senses not enough to understand the world? The answer is a resounding no. Our process for understanding reality is about as reductive as a 1-second movie trailer. The chain of sense perception goes roughly like this:</p>
            <p>1. Everything is vibration.</p>
            <p>2. Of that infinite vibration, we pick up narrow slivers with our 5 senses (an infinitesimal fraction).</p>
            <p>3. Our brain codifies the raw data into intelligible information.</p>
            <p>4. We filter and discard huge chunks of information as noise (background information).</p>
            <p>5. We subconsciously interpret the leftover information by passing it through mental frameworks constructed by past experiences, culture, upbringing, beliefs, values, our self-image, etc — assigning a meaning & judgement on the few chunks of information that have made it this far.</p>
            <p>6. A tiny fraction of the resulting information, which has been flagged as important by our brain, comes into our conscious awareness. The latest neuroscience seems to indicate that by this point, any conscious thinking is more like a post-rationalized attempt at taking ownership of a process that’s already been completed by the subconscious.</p>
            <p>The conscious mind can poke at emerged thought, like a child pokes roadkill with a stick, but by this point, the thought is largely an inanimate object. It’s already defined & determined by the underlying mental frameworks.</p>
            <p>So Sacha, I hear you say, how can we affect our reality? I want to feel like I’m in control of what I perceive. Fair enough. Keep reading.</p>
            <p><u>Change your Framework, Update your Reality</u></p>
            <p>If reality is your collection of assumptions about the world, then to perceive reality accurately is to have the correct assumptions. This is the essence of every spiritual teaching: changing your assumptions.</p>
            <p>Usually, all of our assumptions come from the dubious sensory chain I’ve just described. A spiritual person realizes the fallibility of the chain, and doesn’t trust it to provide a solid foundation for their life.</p>
            <p>This is where the Third Eye comes in. You could say the Third Eye is a way of bypassing the chain of perception. When you come upon a mystical feeling, such as being one with the universe, or being in a state of total peace, or knowing a truth viscerally without external proof, you are perceiving through what many call the Third Eye. You don’t need to think of it as a literal eye, it isn’t. All you need to know is that you have the ability to detect true assumptions through other means than your ordinary senses.</p>
            <p>Mystical, life-changing experiences are rare for the ordinary person. This is why they should be fostered and sought out as a supplement to our ordinary perception. Meditation, psychedelics, being alone in nature — all of these practices can help us intuit deeper truths about reality than our extremely reductionist chain of perception allows.</p>
            <p>My advice: step back from the world. Step back from yourself. Re-examine your assumptions about the way things are. Attachment to illusory assumptions is a huge source of suffering for all of us. Let go. Explore. Find better assumptions about the world.</p>
            <p>The rules of the game should make the game worth playing.<br>Oh, and it is a game.</p>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> – As the topic of the Third Eye approached, I spent couple meditations trying to deepen my understanding of the subject. After watching this talk, expect to know more about chakras, reality, & reaching a state of complete awareness. Enjoy!</p>

            <h3>Thoughtful Discoveries</h3>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> – This week it's all about this magical Indian flute track that will send you to hyperspace as you meditate & let go of wordly problems.</p>
            <p>Also, if you want to spice it up in the bedroom & go deeper, the flute can easily become a spaceship for tantric love. It's worth it, you have my word.</p>
            <div class="youtubeVideo">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mr8GBzTsWqM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - You know how I was saying we discard a ton of information from our senses? Here’s a perfect illustration of that. Normal or “tonal” western music has 12 notes. That’s it. They repeat up and down the piano in what we call octaves, but there’s only 12.</p>
            <p>In that 12-note range, our ear could tell the difference between 120 notes!</p>
            <p>So here’s Dolores Catherino, a pioneer in microtonal music, talking about expanding our musical consciousness, and getting more juice out of our senses. She uses a Tonal Plexus (106 notes per octave) to get subtle effects.</p>
            <p>This may be the next logical evolution of music!</p>

            </div>

            <br>

            <p>Sometimes art manages to translate the magnitude of a Third-Eye experience down to normal perception. This is one of those cases. Smoke, lasers & shivers.</p>

            <p>I also highly recommend you check out Bertil Nilsson’s Naturally. The pictures have a definite power to them. Remember that somewhere in that feeling, there is reality.</p>

            <h3>Gregory's Book Recommendation</h3>
            <div class="imgInTextLong">
                <div class="imgInTextLongPlacement">
                    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1431121.MIND"><img src="../img/editions/007/sivanandaMind.png" alt=""></a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p><b>Book:</b> Mind - Its Mysteries & Control <br> <b>Author:</b> Swami Sivananda<p>
            <p>This book is concept heavy & totally exploded my mind. It's filled with cosmic wisdom coming straight from the great Sivananda. If you are serious about understanding your mind, transcending logic & are ready to reach a state of complete awareness: this book is for you.</p>
            <p>Even though the book bases itself on the Hindu tradition, Sivananda's teachings are definitely universal & are far from the low energies related to religious dogma. As he says so well: The mind is no doubt extremely turbulent. Through repeated attempts you can perfectly subdue it. You are the master of the mind.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Track of the Week</h3>
            <p><span class="Sacha">Gregory</span> – Back in February, I composed this track to heal my heart after going through some rough times. I've been trying to use music as a soul healer & in this case, managed to travel deeper into the internal void. In the process, I started seeing colors & then realized that the purple I saw in front of my eyes was the color associated to the Third Eye!</p>
            <p>This track was meant to be experienced, & as the title says: Close your eyes for 7 minutes & see purple. Enjoy the internal flight!</p>

            <p>Alright! That's it for this edition of the Weekly Dose. Let’s close with a thought from psychoanalyst C.G. Jung: </p>

            <br>

            <h3>The greatest problems in life can never be solved. They must be outgrown, by attaining a new level of consciousness.</h3>

            <br>

            <p>Lastly, don't forget to help one (or five!) of your best friends who are also on the path to become their best selves. Send them this weekly dose, they'll be glad you did!</p>
            <p>Have a wonderful evening,</p>
            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> & <span class="Sacha">Sacha</span></p>
