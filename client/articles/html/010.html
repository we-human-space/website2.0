            <h3>The dictionary definition: Ego</h3>
            <p>A person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance. The part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity. In metaphysics: a conscious thinking subject.</p>
            <h3>The objective:</h3>
            <p>Reconcile with inner peace by diving deep within ourselves to learn to recognize & tame the ego.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Facing the Ego</h3>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - What is the ego? How does it hurt us? More importantly, why would you take any answers from me? I’m supremely unqualified to give you answers on the ego, given that I’m still firmly planted within my own. Listening to my advice would be like taking sobriety tips from a currently drunk alcoholic. Inspiring, but clearly not working too well.</p>
            <p>Ok who’s next? You can ask Freud, who would tell you the ego is the intermediary between your primal urges and societal pressures. But what the hell are you gonna do with that? Cry on a couch? Forget it.</p>
            <p>You can ask Buddhism. As far as I can tell, they really have their shit together when it comes to the ego. They’d tell you that your notion of Self is really an illusion. That if you think about it, you’re a direct continuity of the universe, like a branch on a tree, and that it really doesn’t make sense to think of yourself as something separate from the universe.</p>
            <p>But then again you can’t sign your Income Tax form as “The Universe”, so that leaves some unresolved issues.</p>
            <p>(To be fair, my brief glimpses of insight into the nature of being have backed up Buddhism for me, but words fail to capture them, so we’ll have to try something else).</p>
            <p>For the newcomers, here’s a far-from-exhaustive glimpse of the ego... an array of ego manifestations. Think of them as red flags to code into your mental ego-detector.</p>
            <p>For the ego pros... well... hope you'll smile at the struggle. We're all in this together.</p>
            <p><u>Ego Confessions / Sobriety Tips From An Egoholic</u></p>
            <p>My ego builds a wall between me and other people.</p>
            <p>My ego won’t let me cry, because crying is weak.</p>
            <p>My ego urges me to act like someone I’m not.</p>
            <p>My ego represses “unacceptable” emotions.</p>
            <p>My ego censors & represses risky truths.</p>
            <p>My ego stops me from being vulnerable.</p>
            <p>My ego is a PR firm inside my head.</p>
            <p>My ego tells me I’m inadequate.</p>
            <p>My ego wants your validation.</p>
            <p>My ego pops up every day.</p>
            <p>My ego is a big illusion.</p>
            <p>My ego is misguided.</p>
            <p>My ego is persistent.</p>
            <p>My ego is scarcity.</p>
            <p>My ego is jealous.</p>
            <!-- <p>My ego means well.</p> -->
            <p>My ego will dissolve.</p>
            <p>My ego is nothing.</p>
            <p>My ego.</p>
            <p>My .</p>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> – In the last 4 years, I've been shifting my focus more & more towards the ego. Not because it's pleasant to experience, but on the contrary, because I realized that taming it & getting rid of its illusion, even though emotionally draining, is one of the greatest challenge / success a human can experience.</p>
            <p>In fact, the yogis & buddhists are clear on the subject: Ego is like dust in front of your eyes. Without removing the dust, you can't see anything clearly.</p>
            <p>In the talk below, I share a great insight Ayahuasca gave me about my name, & dive deep into the notions of control & self-projection; Two subjects that I've experienced & replicated over the last years not without great pain.</p>
            <p>I'm far from being a master yet, ego still shows up on a daily basis, but the objective is crystal clear: See it, tame it, & learn from it in order to transcend its veil & reconcile with inner peace.</p>
            <p>Enjoy</p>

            <h3>Thoughtful Discoveries</h3>


            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> - Osho... his eyes that never blink... his way of expressing himself... his fresh & surprising views on life... I guarantee you'll learn something & expand your mind if you take the time to listen to his youtube series.</p>
            <p>His attitude on the ego: Before removing it, you should wait for it to ripen. Hence, let the ego evolve, don't be scared of expressing yourself, & as you grow & make blatant ego mistakes, it will become easier & easier to catch & clear it. The key: make sure you continuously work on raising your awareness levels.</p>

            <p>Towards the end of my video, I referred to the following discovery: Mathematicians & Neuroscientists recently found that you think in multiple dimensions. That's huge for spirituality & science has both fields are slowly uniting over the concepts of mind & consciousness.</p>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - Alan Watts is a man who has done us the great favor of boiling down thousands of years of wisdom from Zen Buddhism, Hinduism & other spiritual traditions into digestible, insightful and witty talks. These Universal-grade metaphysics are the theoretical aspect of evaporating the ego.</p>
            <p>He's been one of my greatest teachers so far. Just the sound of his voice seems to calm my soul. I laugh and smile as he softly debunks some of my most cherished beliefs about reality & eloquently replaces them with better assumptions. These 12 talks helped to dissolve my ego measurably. I’ve listened to them countless times.</p>

            <p><b>Book:</b> Ego is the Enemy <br> <b>Author:</b> Ryan Holiday<p>
            <p>A book that Chloe, Greg and I have thoroughly enjoyed. If you’re looking for a really down-to-earth and practical view of why ego can ruin your life, this is it. Ryan Holiday had early success after dropping out of school at 19, rising to Wonderboy status faster than an antelope strapped to a rocketship. You could say he’s qualified to talk about the challenges of ego in his own life — but instead he talks about how ego caused major trouble for many of history’s most notable humans.</p>

            <p>Alright! That's it for this edition of the Weekly Dose. We leave you with verse 7 from The Book of the Way: </p>

            <br>

            <p><i>The Tao is infinite, eternal. <br>
                Why is it eternal? <br>
                It was never born; <br>
                thus it can never die. <br>
                Why is it infinite? <br>
                It has no desires for itself; <br>
                thus it is present for all beings. <br>
            </i></p>

            <p><i>The Master stays behind; <br>
                that is why she is ahead. <br>
                She is detached from all things; <br>
                that is why she is one with them. <br>
                Because she has let go of herself, <br>
                she is perfectly fulfilled. <br>
            </i></p>

            <br>

            <p>Lastly, don't forget to help one (or five!) of your best friends who are also on the path to become their best selves. Send them this weekly dose, they'll be glad you did!</p>
            <p>Have a wonderful evening,</p>
