            <h3>The dictionary definition: Now</h3>
            <p>At the present time or moment. Used, especially in conversation, to draw attention to a particular statement or point in a narrative.</p>
            <h3>The objective:</h3>
            <p>Foster flow to transcend the linear relationship we have with time & draw 100% our attention to the present moment.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Pursuing the Now</h3>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - <i>One morning, something truly special happened.</i></p>
            <p><i>As I stepped out from her apartment block into the crisp air of the dawn, I was struck by a moment of perfection. I stopped in my tracks. Autumn leaves fell from the sky in slow motion, dancing on the wind. The heavenly swells of Dauðalogn by Sigur Rós emerged from my headphones, caressing my mind. The rising sun’s rays exploded outwards with divine glory. I felt, within my heart, a moment of complete stillness. My head was clear. My heart unclenched. There was a sense of perfect emptiness, in which everything was okay. Everything was okay.</i></p>
            <p>- - - - -</p>
            <p>I was blessed with this electric moment in fall 2013. Complete presence. A glimpse of what it means to live fully in the Now.</p>
            <p>I was leaving the apartment of the girl I was seeing at the time. Let’s call her Lucy. For quite some time before I met her, I had been numb. I thought & felt that I was fairly worthless. This dejection made me disconnect mentally from the world.</p>
            <p>That said, I was highly functional. Everything was “going fine” in my life & I intended to keep it that way, so that everyone could keep patting me on the back, and people wouldn’t worry about me. I didn’t fully occur to me that having no intrinsic motivation & a truly depressing mental landscape was an issue. I was just plagued with a continuous sense of unease. I figured if I just kept going, things would get less bleak eventually.</p>
            <p>Lack of self-awareness meant I had no ability to witness my thoughts with perspective. They absorbed me completely. I was fucked up in the mellowest sense possible.</p>
            <p>Lucy was fucked up too. She had been fighting inner battles for her entire adolescence. She thought she was damaged goods. But I knew she was absolutely gorgeous, inside and out. She thought the same of me, or at least, in the beginning.</p>
            <p>To say it escalated quickly was an understatement. We were sending each other poems by day 3. I loved her then. The smell of her on my pillow hypnotized me. We awakened something in each other. I remember once when she got up from my bed and got dressed near the window. The white light of the morning was streaming down on her with such intensity that she glowed. Tiny particles of dust hung in the sunbeams. In that moment, she was an angel.</p>
            <p>These were impossible feelings for me at the time. Things I simply didn’t feel — except with her. She activated states of awareness in me. Heightened my senses. I felt she was saving me from myself. She thought the same thing of me, I think.</p>
            <p>Everything was elevated. It’s like love was merciful enough to let me stand on its pedestal. From that height, I was closer to living in the Now than I had been in years. So close in fact, that one morning, I pierced the upper threshold of my unconsciousness and saw the world as it was… if only for a brief, transcendental moment. Like peering over the walls of the grey mental prison of ego.</p>
            <p>Looking back, it’s no surprise that this most intense moment of Nowness arose from a space of love. My intuition tells me love and presence are interwoven in ways I can’t explain.</p>
            <p>What happened next? The moment passed. Lucy & I slowly were overtaken by our lower selves & conditioned patterns. We sunk in proportion. Things sputtered out and we parted ways. Maybe we’ll talk about that when Relationships come up as a weekly theme.</p>
            <p>As for Living in the Now, I hate to say that I didn’t get to stay in that magical place I saw on that cold autumn morning. In fact, I didn’t even recognise the experience for what it was until years later when I encountered theories about the Now. Buddhists have a word for it: Satori. A moment of no-mind in which the essence of the world is revealed. Just a glimpse. A fleeting revelation. It’s one of the earliest steps on the path to enlightenment. Why was it so transient?</p>
            <p>When we don’t know what’s happening to us, we can’t direct it or maintain it. This is the importance of theory & of self-awareness. Being able to recognize our mental state, put it into context & then transmute our inner state is something that requires research & practice.</p>
            <p>Whatever cost of time & effort it takes is worth it. Our entire life stems from our inner world. Not having the language to understand the inner world, or the awareness to examine it, is to leave the entire endeavour of life up to chance. Steering blind.</p>
            <p>The good news is you don’t need to be in love to experience the Now. It’s here at all times. If we can quiet our incessant mental chatter & surrender our ego, we can access a higher plane of being — a state of oneness with the universe. Inner peace. A place where everything flows naturally.</p>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> – This week, I'm trying something new by directly responding to a video made by Ralph, a wise brother from the internet who has nailed the concept of linear time.</p>
            <p>The objective is to add a personal perspective to the subject & hopefully give you 1-2 ideas to try out in your life to start bending your reality the way you want. As time & space are linked together, a different perspective on time allows for a different reality to emerge from it!</p>
            <p>Let's start with Ralph's video for an introduction on the subject.</p>

            <div class="youtubeVideo">

            <p>Second Part: My perspective & experience on transcending time / bending your reality.</p>

            <p>Enjoy</p>

            <h3>Thoughtful Discoveries</h3>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> - Jamie Wheal has been doing some amazing work in the field of transcendence & consciousness. As a pionneer in deciphering human performance, he talks a lot about the notion of selflessness & its repercussion on the perception of time is a recurring theme.</p>
            <p>In the following interview, keep an open mind as Jamie debunks many of society's deeply ingrained belief systems, many of which are inhibiting us from transcending our little self. He proposes an escape route from the narrow conception of time, which the majority of us have unconsciously adopted.</p>
            <p>Also, if you're wondering what the link between Psychedelics & Time is, here you go: these substances are known for temporarily shutting down the brain circuitry which manage our construct & understanding of time. Hence, on mushrooms, LSD, or DMT, it's quite likely you'll transcend the cultural construct of time. :)</p>
            <div class="youtubeVideo">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2pL-hQyKds" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>In my video, I referred to the concept of transcending time by using visualization to bend reality the way you want. These concepts might appear as being "out there" but they aren't. Here's a wonderful talk from Moran Cerf, a Neuroscience PhD & visiting faculty member @ MIT addressing the same concepts & backing them up with a greater scientific understanding.</p>
            <p>I have a strong vision about these subjects & firmly believe that it's time for all of us to rethink everything we've been told. We're much greater & much more capable of building a wonderful world than we think!</p>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - At the peak of the LSD movement in the 1970s, Ram Dass rose in the face of an approaching chaos by pursuing the spiritual path & releasing the book: "Be Here Now".</p>
            <p>On his side, Eckhart Tolle lived a depressed life until the age of 29 before finding inner bliss & moving on to write one of the most popular american spiritual book of all time: "The Power of Now".</p>
            <p>In the interview below, it's interesting to see how these two monuments share their anecdotes / perspectives & stories. In the end, if you fuse their body of work, you can extract the following life lesson: "Be Here Now" to experience "The Power of Now".</p>
            <p>Finally, the talk itself is also an opportunity to be present. Ram Dass was hit by a stroke some years ago, which makes his speech quite slow at times. Being able not to judge his verbal stumbles & long pauses is an exercise is Nowness all by itself. Go in without judgement & feel the truth underneath. Accept the moments of silence.</p>
