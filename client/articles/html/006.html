            <p><b>The dictionary definition: Coherence</b><br>1. The quality of being logical and consistent.<br>2. The quality of forming a unified whole.<br><i>– Oxford Dictionary</i></p>
            <p>Inner coherence has been one of the hardest challenges we've experienced in our lives. Mastering our thoughts & feelings requires daily work, but it’s key if we want to reach our full potential!</p>
            <p><b>The objective:</b><br> Remove inner conflict & friction to experience & be of one mind.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Pursuing the Smiles of Life</h3>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span>– The Dynamics of Internal Friction</p>
            <p>There’s a battle going on inside our unconscious mind. On one side, the Parasite. On the other, your Inner Compass. The Parasite wants you to seek comfort. It wants you to binge on food and hibernate and survive. It wants the easy way out. It wants entertainment. Drama. Distractions. Anything to keep you from the hard stuff.</p>
            <p>The problem with the easy way, as I’m sure you know, is that despite the immediate gratification it brings, it’s profoundly shallow.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Inner Compass guides you towards greatness. It’s true north is self-actualization & fulfillment. Almost invariably, following it means climbing your personal mountain. And I don’t mean that in a corporate ladder sort of way. I mean you working to manifest your full potential. The Inner Compass highlights your path with Smiles of Life, like breadcrumbs you should follow.</p>
            <p>Now the Parasite is a sneaky little shit, and he’ll give you really good arguments.<br>“Oh we worked so hard yesterday, we deserve a break.” <br>“Sure you could pursue your calling, but then you’d have to deal with uncertainty!” <br> “Money is what you really want. Don’t start that project. Get a normal job.” <br> “Life is scary, just stay home.” <br> “If you publish your art, people will judge you.”</p>
            <p>These mental dialogues give us anxiety. Fear. For me, it manifests itself as a tightness around the heart.</p>
            <p>We feel this because in truth, our intentions are aligned with growth, but our primal urges are going in the opposite direction. These opposing forces are what I call internal friction.</p>
            <p>So while your Inner Compass is showing you the way to world-shaking, transcendental glory, the Parasite is sneaking up behind you with ice cream and a chloroform rag: “Shhhhh… shhhhhhh… there you go, back to sleep little human”.</p>
            <p><u>Don’t weaponize your mind, just bring out the searchlights</u></p>
            <p>For a long time I thought I should beat myself up about negative thoughts (oh the irony). I thought it would make me progress through brute strength and willpower.</p>
            <p>After lots of research and some breakthroughs, here’s the right way: <br>Develop your awareness. That’s 80% of the game.</p>
            <p>You are not your thoughts. Distance yourself from your thoughts and observe them as though they were natural phenomena arising from the outside. When you have counter-productive urges, have a chuckle at that rascal Parasite, who clearly is trying to seduce & submit you once again. It’s like that ghost Boo in Mario Bros. When you see him, he stops. Breathe, and watch that urge fade into the distance.</p>
            <p>This is a huge component of inner peace. A bit more awareness every day. With time, you’ll ignore the dark & climb that mountain towards the light :) </p>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> – I really felt like doing a little video this week to help you better understand why we're aligning our project with the stars and dig deeper into my relationship with coherence. In all honesty, I've worked really hard to align my smiles of life with my actions in the last couple years and I hope that you'll better understand the importance of developing the courage to trust your inner voice.</p>

            <h3>Thoughtful Discoveries</h3>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> – Binaural Beats... the magical link between music and neuroscience! It's been shown that the mind and its emotions emit specific brain waves. The underlying trick behind binaural beats is to "hack" your brain by listening to the waves that correspond to the inner world you want to create.</p>
            <p>Today, amid a sea of poorly written binaural music, I stumbled upon this magnificient one. Within 5 minutes, I experienced deep calm and felt at peace. Some soothing material right there! Too bad they didn't keep the eye of horus the whole time and opted for some cheesy visuals. I suggest you just run in it in the background while you relax and let go :)</p>

            <p><b>Book:</b> The War of Art – Winning the Inner Creative Battle <br> <b>Author:</b> Steven Pressfield<p>
            <p>Let’s face it. It’s hard to do what you need to do. Ironically, our greatest, most important work is the easiest work to put off. This wonderful collection of insights will help you get back into a state of religious reverence towards your art, your craft, your business, or whatever it is you’re creating.</p>
            <p>An absolute must for developing a supreme work ethic.</p>

            <h3>Track of the Week</h3>
            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> – We’re trying something special this week. I made a little sound experiment to express the change from inner friction to inner coherence. If you’d like tension & release, see Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture. I stole his violins, but he did it way better.</p>
            <p>Sunshine & violins will help you find inner peace.</p>
