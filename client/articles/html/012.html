            <h3>The dictionary definition: Sync</h3>
            <p>Synchronization. The operation or activity of two or more things at the same time or rate.</p>
            <h3>The objective:</h3>
            <p>Improve daily communication & seek experiences allowing us to transcend it. In the end, it's about becoming one both in thoughts & feelings.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Pursuing the Sync</h3>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - We founded human.space on the principle that your inner world shapes your outer world. If we cultivate that inner world, the rest will follow. Purpose, self-knowledge, skills, compassion & all that jazz. That said, the inner world is not a one-way system. We’re constantly being shaped by our experience of the outer world. Most of the time, that means being shaped by other people.</p>
            <p>Turns out we’re even more connected to each other than thought. More on that in a second.</p>
            <p><u>The Illusion of the Separate Self</u></p>
            <p>These recent centuries have been dominated by the idea that everything can be explained by breaking it down into components. Isolating components to explain the whole. Along with a rising individualism, it’s easy to imagine we’re all just “poor little me” doing our best to survive this world.</p>
            <p>Wonderful news: in some sort of psychedelic revelation come true, the latest neuroscience is showing we’re all connected, all the way to the level of brainwaves.</p>
            <p><i>What.</i> Read on.</p>
            <p><u>Inter-Brain Synchronization</u></p>
            <p>A recent study by the Basque Centre on Cognition, Brain and Language called has shown that people’s brain waves sync when they’re in conversation — to the point that scientists can identify people having a conversation “solely by analyzing their brainwaves”. Our language foreshadowed this with ideas such as “being on the same wavelength”. That is literally the case.</p>
            <p><u>The Implications of Sync</u></p>
            <p>Okay so if EEGs (electroencephalograms) are showing that our brains sync in human interactions, what does that mean for us?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It means our emotional state is contagious. But we already knew that. Just turns out to be even more intense than we thought. It’s an actual electromagnetic sync. That means if our inner world is beautiful, we can uplift everyone we meet. Of course, that’s a double edged sword. We should strive to spot when we’re dragging others down.</li>
                <li>There are dangers for the wavering mind. In an attempt to empathize with others, we might could end up syncing to the lowest common denominator. So maybe its best to accept that we just won’t get along with some people if they’re not in a position to sync up to the higher frame.</li>
                <li>Ever heard “you’re the sum of the 5 people you see most”? More than ever it seems that we should surround ourselves with an ecosystem of bright minds. People who are better than us in some aspects. If we can make an agreement that we’ll always try to sync to the higher frame, we’re on a path for explosive growth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There’s so much I wish I knew about this topic. All I can really do is point at the rabbit hole suggestively. To me this is just another way that science and spirituality are coming together after centuries of discord.</p>
            <p>I’d love to hear your thoughts, write us for a chat any time :)</p>
            <p>Sync upwards my friends!</p>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> – As I look back onto the last couple years, I realize that most of my energy has been spent trying to synchronize visions & belief systems amongst the people that surround me.</p>
            <p>In the video below, you'll hear 3 totally different stories describing the process & experiences in which unity showed up between individuals. Here's the big takeaway: Authenticity, transparency & vulnerability are the key to the receptor's heart.</p>
            <p>It's time to dive!</p>

            <h3>Thoughtful Discoveries</h3>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> - The great master Sadhguru goes deeper into the different dimensions of the mind & explains how telepathic communication happens.</p>
            <p>The good news: if you're willing to drop the illusion of the "modern" mind, you'll be on your way to transcend logic & tap into the real magic.</p>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - Dr. Ramachandran had made a name for himself exploring some of the more mysterious aspects of neuroscience, such as phantom limbs. In this talk, he covers Mirror Neurons, another manifestation of Brain Sync. It’s a short talk, but it’ll get you started down the rabbit hole!</p>

            <h3>Our Track of the Week</h3>
            <p>Music is one of the beautiful ways to get in sync collectively. It’s something we knew all the way back in early tribes, carried into to spiritual traditions and now onto the dancefloor. It’s a way for us to merge into something communal. Feels good to be One.</p>

            <p>Alright! That's it for this edition of the Weekly Dose. Let's close with a quote from Cal Fussman, one of the greatest interviewers of our times, on proper communication:</p>

            <br>

            <h3>First, go for the heart. Second, reach for the head. Then, you'll have a pathway to the soul.</h3>

            <br>

            <p>Lastly, don't forget to help one (or five!) of your best friends who are also on the path to become their best selves. Send them this weekly dose, they'll be glad you did!</p>
            <p>Have a wonderful evening,</p>
