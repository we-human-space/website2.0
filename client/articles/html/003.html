            <p>Our theme of the week: The power of thoughts & imagination.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Pursuing the Smiles of Life</h3>

            <p><span class="Chloe">Chloé</span> - <i>“We are what we think. All that we are arises from our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world.”</i> -Buddha</p>
            <p>My dad first told me about the huge power the mind when I was around 10 years old. I was pretty sceptical about his words. “If it were true, then why weren’t we taught it at school?” With time, I became more & more open to the idea. As I tried visualization, meditation and mantras, I started to experience what the Buddha meant for myself.</p>
            <p>According to my latest reads on mind mastery: To follow your path, you have to make an effigy out of your Smiles of Life. Your moments of completeness & deep fulfillment, need to be blown out of proportion and become your North Star. You need to develop a religious devotion to these moments, understanding that you must suffer and sacrifice so that you may receive them occasionally. This is the only path to mastery.</p>
            <p>Our mind shapes our reality. The more intensity we put into our thoughts, the more they impact the world.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> - Couple weeks ago, I was walking back home and observed a child playing with a little truck. Being part of that scene totally reminded me that one of our specie's greatest gift rests in our ability to imagine sceneries, dream, and visualize objects!</p>
            <p>For example, why was the kid on the street so excited by that little truck? In my perspective, the situation was totally basic and didn't offer much to rejoice over and over again! However, after observing him for couple minutes, it became clear that the answer I was looking for had to do with the kid's mind state. He allowed the toy to become a catalyst for his imagination. The child naturally gave himself the permission to create wonder worlds, positive scenarios, and beautiful characters from the toy presented to him. The happiness, focused gaze, and innocent smiles appearing on his face simply mirrored what was happening inside of him!</p>
            <p>From that situation, isn't clear that kids exemplify the motto "Do more with less" really well? I can guarantee you that you'll find these little creatures (yes, there is CREATE in creature) extracting a maximum of happiness and imaginative juice out of the bare minimum all around the globe! So, what is their secret according to yogis?</p>
            <p>They are absolutely open minded and free from the constraints of the ego. Without any surprise here, it then follows that imagination thrives and flourishes in such a mental space. Therefore, as "grown ups", what are we waiting for to become dreamers and use our consciousness, skills, and life experiences to bring these thoughts to reality? That is the challenge.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Thoughtful Discoveries</h3>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> - This week, I want to introduce you to the works of Dorothy Fadiman, a wonderful movie director and the wife of James Fadiman, an American psychologist who became famous for his research on psychedelics.</p>
            <p>Throughout "Shattering the Myth of Aging", one of my favourite short movie from Dorothy, you'll be left in awe as you watch some old folks telling their story and compete at the seniors' olympics! For example, you'll see old ladies high jump, and hear about a 94 years old champion running 400m. It's mind blowing.</p>
            <p>These old athletes absolutely embody the concept of "Mind over Matter" and totally embraced the power of thoughts. As they say themselves: it all started with a DECISION.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - They say you’re the average of the 5 people you see most. I can attest to that. My world has changed big time since I met the people behind this crew… It was questioned, shaken, expanded & uplifted.</p>
            <p>Now that I’m on my own in Sydney, I get to choose who I get to know here very carefully. If I were a plant, it would be like getting to choose the soil I grow in. That’s why this week I went out to the Sydney Spiritual Network’s meetup (very nutrient dense to feed the plant in me). What a great experience. Met some great folks driven by the same purpose, and had couple eye-opening conversations with some loving, open minded people.</p>
            <p>By immersing myself in an environment which is aligned with my goals, it fed my soul and helped me grow! :D I used meetup.com to find these new friends in Sydney. Super easy, and even though the groups on the app can be cheesy sometimes, it's worth exploring and giving it a try! Find your people, and harness the power of being surrounded by great minds!</p>

            <h3>Sacha's Book Recommendation</h3>
            <p>To be honest, I thought this book would be too “Murica” for my taste. Don’t judge a book by it’s cover. Beneath the surface, these two elite Navy SEALS lay out the framework responsible for their success in the most dangerous war zone in the world.</p>
            <div class="imgInText">
                    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848190-extreme-ownership"><img src="../img/editions/003/extremeOwnership.png" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>Here's the fundamental question behind the book:</p>
            <p>What methods and tactics are behind the most effective Navy SEALS team?</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, according to the authors, it was all in the mind. Throughout the book, you'll enter a gritty world of hellish training regimens, violent conflict in the streets & crisis in the headquarters — and learn how Delta team thinks in order to accomplish the most challenging missions.</p>
            <p>That said, the very core of the book is about taking 100% responsibility for your own actions & decisions — and how that translates into the highest form of self-leadership & team leadership. That’s something we can all learn from.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Good Food</h3>
            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> - I've spent a lot of time thinking and reflecting in the last couple months, and also pushed myself to cut lots of my expenses. The result: I became imaginative regarding the food I eat and started trying things out! Here's my first official recipe, and it's freaking delicious. On top of that, the intention behind the recipe is to give you the energy to materialize your wildest dreams. It's working on my side, so hopefully, you try it too!</p>
            <div class="imgInText">
                    <a href=""><img src="../img/editions/003/chocolate.png" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <p>- 1 banana<br>- 2 cups of quinoa<br>- 3 cups of water<br>- 1 generous slice of butter<br>- 2 pieces of dark chocolate</p>
            <p>First, I like to make food in batch to save some time throughout the week. With 2 cups of Quinoa and the 3 cups of water, you should have enough Quinoa for 5-6 days of supply! Just bring the 3 cups of water to ebullition, and then, add the quinoa as you lower the fire. Cook for 15 minutes.</p>
            <p>Once the quinoa is made, the magical recipe only takes 2 minutes to make!</p>
            <p>Take a bowl, add 6-7 table spoons of quinoa, add the banana (cut into slices), add the slice of butter, and add the 2 pieces of chocolate.</p>
            <p>Put the bowl 50 seconds into the microwave and smash it all together with your spoon until you get a pudding like texture pudding. Voila!</p>
            <p>Just do it. It's cheap, tastes like heaven and it'll fuel your dreams!</p>
            <p>Guaranteed.</p>

            </div>
            <h4>Track: Open Eye Signal</h4>
            <p>Album: Immunity<br>Artist: Jon Hopkins</p>
            <p>One of many masterpieces on Immunity. Jon expresses the nature of determination & persistence in this 8 minute clip. Align yourself with his energy and you can do anything. Know your destination, and never give up.</p>
            <p>The track itself is clearly the result of a shifted thinking, breaking conventional song structures, opting to focus entirely on it’s central theme for a fantastically sensitive 6 minute crescendo.</p>
