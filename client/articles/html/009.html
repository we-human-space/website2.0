            <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>If you rolled your eyes at this week’s theme, we understand. Google it, and you enter a world of mushy quotes & very questionable typographic choices.</p>
            <p>We ask only this. Don’t be fooled by the cheesy surface of this topic. Just beneath the parmesan, there’s gold. Living From The Heart is not a quote in Comic Sans on a sunset picture. It’s a mode of being, which — just maybe — could be what you’ve been looking for your entire life. Read on.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>The dictionary definition: Heart</h3>
            <p>The heart regarded as the center of a person's thoughts and emotions, especially love or compassion. One's mood or feeling. The central or innermost part of something. The vital part or essence.</p>
            <h3>The objective:</h3>
            <p>Learn to trust our heart's language - intuition - to live our life to the fullest.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Pursuing the Heart</h3>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> – The Self-Fulfilling Prophesy of the Human Doughnut</p>
            <p>Many of us are living with a broken paradigm: sincerely feeling & believing that we have a gaping hole in our soul. A vague sensation that we’re incomplete. But wait! If we can get that dream job, we’ll finally be happy. Or maybe once we meet that special someone, fall in love & la di da. You get the idea. While that certainly makes a great template for movies — which is probably where we got this notion from — it’s a misguided way to live.</p>
            <p>Ever heard of the Hedonic treadmill? That’s what makes lottery winners miserable again after a few months. You can literally win a lifetime of material rewards, and still be a human doughnut. Ouch.</p>
            <p>Lesson learned. No amount of “stuff” will plug this hole. The more we get, the more we want. The more we want, the less we’re happy. Repeat.</p>
            <p>I suggest this: don’t be mad at the hole, it’s just doing it’s job. Holes are made for good stuff to disappear into, much like black holes absorb light or your mouth absorbs avocado. Nevertheless, the hole in our soul is a problem. I agree. So what are we going to do about it?</p>
            <p><u>Reversing The Flow</u></p>
            <p>In this scenario, happiness flows in from the outside, and disappears into the hole. The solution is to reverse the flow. If the old paradigm is to perpetually seek, take, hoard & protect until the hole is filled (energy flowing in), the new paradigm is to give, provide, share and love (energy flowing out). This turns a hole into a source.</p>
            <p>This is hard. When we’re in a place of lack (doughnut mode), our instinct is to put ourselves first, at all costs. Survival mode. It seems absurd to think that helping others will help us. It seems counter-intuitive — even paradoxical — that giving makes us richer.</p>
            <p>Think of it this way, if it were obvious, everyone would be doing it. Countless advanced teachings are veiled in the paradoxical, which throws us off their scent. The mistake we make is assuming that the emotional/spiritual world functions with the same rules as the material world. Though they are interconnected (we’ll talk about this in another edition), their principles are sometimes diametrically opposed.</p>
            <p><u>Here’s the underlying dynamic:</u></p>
            <p>By giving of ourselves, of our caring, of our help, of our attention, we are implying that we have more than enough to share. This is powerful. Implicitly, our mental model of ourselves changes from a doughnut to that of an overflowing source of love. From lack of abundance, inner poverty & being a taker, to inner riches & becoming a genuine giver. A good trade, if you ask me.</p>



            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> – I first got a glimpse at living from the heart at the age of 17 during a piano class. After going through a rough time with a girl, I decided to finally let go in front of my piano teacher & express myself without repressing & filtering my feelings.</p>
            <p>To this day, the performance that followed remains my best ever & since then, learning to be more vulnerable in order to better express my inner world has been a priority. As the story evolved & Ayahuasca entered my world, I got the opportunity to dive even deeper into the underlying universal principle guiding it all: Love.</p>
            <p>If you want to glimpse at the teachings of Ayahuasca & understand the link between vulnerability, trust & love: this one is for you.</p>
            <p>Finally, I also decided to make it a bit more special by recording the video during the solar eclipse. It takes 4min to explain the foundations, but after, the intensity escalates quickly. The last couple minutes are about a vision of the futureworld & an invitation to invent it together.</p>
            <p>Enjoy</p>

            <h3>Gregory's Track of the Week</h3>
            <p>I was going to share a track from the great pianist Horowitz, but then, realized that I experienced a real "from the heart" moment this week!</p>
            <p>After meeting someone who is going through a rough situation & trying to help her get a step in the right direction to follow her intuition, I came back home & started singing for the first time.</p>
            <p>I totally let go & tried to make a track that expresses the transition from inner tension to soothing energy. For the soothing part, I recited a sanskrit prayer that we sing at the end of every yoga class.</p>
            <p>Hope you'll enjoy the little hyperspace travel & will cope with my untrained voice!</p>
            <p>Peace & Love</p>
