            <p>This week, we touch upon following your North Star, the world of Cheetahs, ear cleaning,  seeking for meaning, and the Apex of techno. Enjoy!</p>

            <h3>Pursuing the Smiles of Life</h3>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> - After two years of experience with startups, I’ve learned that almost nothing comes easily. The key is to take 100% responsibility for your actions and get to work. As a founder, everything is hinging on you. The mental strength required to push through is immense, but the rewards are huge.</p>
            <p>That’s why I resonate so much with Bruce Lee when he says: <i>“Do not wish for an easy life. Wish for the strength to endure a difficult one”.</i></p>
            <p>Dreams are hard to accomplish. They take focus & continuous effort. I believe that as a part of this generation — a generation more equipped and enlightened than ever, everyone has the duty to stand up and take action for their dreams. If you don't stand up for yourself, who will?</p>
            <p>Stay strong seekers</p>

            <p></p>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - The Smile of Life is a passing event. You can’t expect to be grinning every minute you spend working on your life’s task. Currently, I’m studying electronic music & sound design in Sydney. It’s amazing. I’m on my path to mastering the craft of music, which makes me tremendously happy. But it doesn’t always feel like that. Sometimes I spend hours trying to coax out a song on Ableton Live, only to end up with a steaming pile of shit. Sometimes I don’t even bother pressing Save. But I don’t give up. Why?</p>
            <p>Because I’ve had a Smile of Life. Or five. Or forty. I forget. But it doesn’t matter. Because now when I experience a brief moment where everything is right in the world, I use it to cancel out every single shitty hour spent struggling to get it tight. It overrides everything else. That’s a decision.</p>
            <p>To follow your path, you have to make an effigy out of your Smiles of Life. Your moments of completeness & deep fulfillment, need to be blown out of proportion and become your North Star. You need to develop a religious devotion to these moments, understanding that you must suffer and sacrifice so that you may receive them occasionally. This is the only path to mastery.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Thoughtful Discoveries</h3>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> - Here's my top 3:</p>

            </div>
            <p>Watch Olivier, a badass and beautiful man, go through his life stories with Lions and Cheetahs. His observations on the behaviour of these wild beasts can easily be transferred to us: "The dominance belongs to the ones with the strongest personalities, not the strongest bodies." Seems like even in the Cheetah world, the ones that are on the path to self-mastery end up leading the way hehe</p>

            <br>

            <div class="imgInText">
                <a href="http://www.visualcapitalist.com/jeff-bezos-empire-chart/"><img src="../img/editions/002/jeffBezos.png" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>Jeff Bezos is the amazing/crazy CEO behind Amazon. The graphics in that article are super interesting and will give you the entire picture behind Bezos' vision. After all, he's the man who said: "It's easier to invent the future than to predict it". For having read his biography, it's pretty clear that you have to be fearless and limitless in your thinking to achieve something on such a big scale. The good news: if Jeff did it, so can you!</p>

            <br>

            <div class="imgInText">
                <a href="https://www.sketchbookproject.com/collections"><img src="../img/editions/002/sketchBook.png" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>Imagine a place where you are surrounded by 36,000 personal sketchbooks from people and artists from all around the world. Well, that place exists and it is called the Brooklyn Art Library. The beauty: they also digitalized some sketchbooks, and you can check it out. Just click the button below  and start scrolling :) You'll definitely be struck by a feeling of awe as you go through them. Enjoy!</p>

            <br>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - I've stumbled upon a crucial resource for musicians, music aficionados & audiophiles. The modern world is so polluted with sound that many of us have forgotten how to listen. To hear with a Beginner’s Mind — like a Buddhist master or a world-class composer — we must clean out our ears. More importantly, we must clean out our minds. We have a notion that some sounds are background noise, a nuisance or a distraction, and that others are important & valuable. This skews our perception, taking us further away from reality, and from a master’s understanding of music.</p>
            <div class="imgInText">
                <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/2/2d/Schafer_R_Murray_Ear_Cleaning_Notes_for_an_Experimental_Music_Course.pdf"><img src="../img/editions/002/earCleaning.png" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>The author Schaefer takes us inside sound itself, so we might feel it viscerally, in our gut. He introduces us to its intrinsic imagery — light & dark, heaven & hell, texture & line — so we might develop a kind of synaesthesia; seeing music in our minds' eye.</p>
            <p>That being said, learn to hear once again and go deeper than ever before into one of your dominant senses with that short pdf read.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Chloé's Book Recommendation</h3>
            <p>Man's Search for Meaning is a great book to keep in your library and reread a few times, especially when you feel lost in your life; when you cannot find any source of Smiles of Life and when you feel overwhelmed or discouraged by negative events or thoughts. The author reminds us what our souls are truly looking for: meaning. Not distraction, neither pleasure.</p>
            <div class="imgInText">
                    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning"><img src="../img/editions/002/searchMeaning.png" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <h4>Book: Man's Search for Meaning</h4>
            <p>Author: Viktor E. Frankl</p>
            <p>To put you into context, Frankl, a psychiatrist, talks about his own survival in Nazi death camps. How did he managed to pursue life while being separated from his wife and children, living in horrible conditions and seeing his friends giving up on life and dying?</p>
            <p>The key answer and takeaway: he found meaning in his suffering by choosing love over fear. Indeed, Frankl shows how love always wins over fear on the long term, no matter what situation you'll find yourself into.</p>

            <h3>Track of the Week</h3>
            <p>This week, we wanted to make you discover the apex of hard techno. We can't stop dreaming of a proper rave with [KRTM] since we discovered him!</p>
            <div class="youtubeVideo">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ipVrmEdaHrU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <h4>Track: Touch Me</h4>
            <p>Album: Baldboy EP<br>Artist: [KRTM]</p>
            <p>Touch Me is the first track on the EP, and it's the best techno track we've heard in 4 years. [KRTM] managed to bridge a deep sense of vulnerability and sensitivity to absolute killer percussion sections. Absolute genius music that will blow your mind and heal your soul.</p>
            <p>As if the track wasn't enough, a fan made an insane video montage that adds even more "grandeur" to the music. Let go, and check it out my friend.</p>

            <br>

            <p>All right! This is it for the 2nd edition of the Weekly Dose.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Face your fears & choose love. You can do it!</h3>

            <br>

            <p>Lastly, if you want to help one (or five!) of your best friends who are also on the path to become their best selves, send them this weekly dose, they'll be glad you did!</p>
            <p>Have a wonderful day,</p>
