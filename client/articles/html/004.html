            <p>Nature. Nothing can connect us to the essence of this life better than nature. From sublime scenes which strike us with awe & wonder, to the quiet harmony of a walk in the forest, to the insights a master gains from studying the behaviour of water… Nature is our teacher. Forever available, asking nothing, giving everything.</p>
            <p>This week, we explore some learnings gleaned from the cold and some wonderful art inspired by nature herself.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Pursuing the Smiles of Life</h3>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span>- Wim Hof, also known as “The Ice Man”, is known for climbing Mount Everest in shorts, swimming 70 meters under the ice in a frozen lake & running a marathon barefoot above the freezing arctic circle. Plot twist: You can thrive in the cold too.</p>
            <p>Wim is adamant that his combination of breathing techniques & exposure to cold can connect us back with our primal self, unlocking hidden powers buried in our own physiology, and allowing us to withstand cold for extended periods of time. Not only that, these techniques cure depression, increase overall health and, strangest of all, allow us to consciously control of our immune system (imagine triggering an immune response when you feel a cold coming on, so you don’t get sick).</p>
            <p>Seems far fetched? For years, many thought Wim was a circus freak, until he voluntarily exposed himself (+ 12 of his students) to a barrage of scientific tests in a controlled laboratory setting. The tests confirm they can do it.</p>
            <p>I’ve experienced the power of the Wim Hof method myself. It destroyed my skepticism.</p>
            <p>My goal is to use breathing & the power of the mind to go beyond the duality of cold & hot. Essentially, with the right method, you can become one with the cold, and it no longer bothers you. In fact, a feeling of supreme wellness comes over you.</p>
            <p><u>Let’s set the scene:</u></p>
            <p>The temperature was -12°C in the snowy wilderness of Quebec. Gregory and I were at his wooden cabin near a frozen lake, the night had a pale glow, illuminated by the moon on the snow. It was time to go.</p>
            <p>I went outside and began the cycles of 30 deep breaths suggested by Wim. It wasn’t working. I was shivering hard. Standing in front of the lake in only my boxers and shoes, the slight breeze seemed to pierce right through me. Bone chilling. After 5 minutes, I was about ready to give up.</p>
            <p>Then I figured I had a last resort. I walked over to an evergreen tree, which of course seemed fully suited to this environment. I asked the tree: “How do you do it? How do you stay in the cold with no problem at all?” My mind supplied a voice for the tree: “It’s in my nature” it said. Very matter-of-factedly.</p>
            <p>Right then & there, I decided being in the cold was in my nature too. And something amazing happened. I thawed out completely. A wave of wellness came over me, and the cold no longer existed. Greg and I proceeded to take a half-hour walk by the lake. Covered only by my boxers, I did not feel a tinge of cold for the rest of the walk. When we came in, Greg put his hand on my chest to check out if it was cold. It was like a furnace.</p>
            <p>I didn’t get sick. In fact, I felt energized and boosted for the next few days.</p>
            <p>Now, check out the legend himself, Mr. Wim Hof, bringing us back to our primal physiological power in this short documentary. Love you Wim!</p>

            <h3>Thoughtful Discoveries</h3>

            <p><span class="Chloe">Chloé</span> - In this short film commissioned by the clothing brand Anaak, <a class="linkInText" href="http://www.georgiatribuiani.com/">Georgia Tribuiani</a> surpassed herself by harmonizing the relationship between humans and nature. As a master of her craft, she invites us to embrace nature in its entirety, letting go of the fear of the unknown. Put it in full screen and enter a world of synchronicity where human beauty connects with the one of plants, shells, light and waves. Surrender to a state of calmness and let wonder enter your mind.</p>

            <p><span class="Geoffroy">Geoffroy</span> - Look at the creations of Virgilio Martínez, one of the most unique and talented chef in America. At his restaurant, Central, in Lima, the dishes are created to reflect the various and breathtaking landscapes of Peru.</p>
            <p>Martínez and his team are showing us the way to experience the culture, history and truth of the country trough sophisticated food. A truly new approach to the food culture shaped by the thoughts of a visionary man.</p>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - in his frame-by-frame video collage named F l o v” e r 2006, the artist Huang Po-Chih takes flowers for a stretch. In my mind, it’s as if he was releasing the life energy contained in these beautiful plants.</p>
            <p><i>"After the end of a love affair and the death of a loved one, he made thousands of scans of flowers, pressing and rolling and sweeping them across the glass. Then he painstakingly retouched and assembled them into Flov”er 2006 (2006), a stop-frame animation that is part waltz, part funeral wreath."</i></p>

            <h3>Track of the Week</h3>
            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span>- There's definitely one artist that comes to my mind when nature becomes the subject of attention: Recondite. Even though I'm not convinced about the artistic direction he took in the last 2 years, the man has an early discography inspired by the time he spent recording raw samples straight from the woods of Berlin.</p>
            <p>In a 2013 <a class="linkInText" href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/1925">interview</a> with Resident Advisor, he shares all of his thought process, and definitely emphasizes the importance of finding an environment that grounds you into yourself and never fails to inspire you.</p>

            <p>Let us close this 4th edition with a great thought from the Lao Tzu, father of Taoism:</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Nature does not hurry. Yet everything is accomplished.</h3>

            <br>
