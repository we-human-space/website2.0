            <h3>Pursuing the Smiles of Life</h3>
            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> - My lesson of the week pertains to the notion of Acceptance. Still having a hard time staying calm when people argue with me & their positions are weak or misinformed... In the end, we need to remind ourselves that it's not about being right or wrong. It's just about expressing ourselves with accuracy, empathy, and wit. The question remains... How do we do that? </p>
            <p>I believe that it's our duty to develop our self-awareness, to catch ourselves when we make mental mistakes. We have to make sure to leave our egos out of the conversation, and truly listen to the other with detachment from the outcome. However, I'm also tempted to say that we should set up accountability systems with the people that are closest to us. Systems that help reach consensus & get back on track — instead of heading straight into the infinite hamster wheel of arguments. A big challenge right there! Gotta love the never ending path to enlightenment :)</p>

            <h3>Thoughtful Discoveries</h3>
            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> - This week's highlight definitely comes from diving deeper into the VR world. I feel like the early adopters and visionaries of the VR space are probably experiencing the same emotions Colombus went through when he stumbled upon America.</p>
            <p>In fact, the "HOLY SHIT, HERE'S AN UNTOUCHED LAND OF MASSIVE OPPORTUNITIES" feeling struck me hard, and I can't wait to get my feet wet with Unreal Engine. I'll make sure to keep you guys updated on the vision and projects we have for our game development label :D</p>
            <p>Here are my top 3 discoveries:</p>

            <br>

                <iframe width="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fc8_Vcw4EHM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>Watch Samskara, a freaking amazing visual experience. Clearly inspired by DMT and hyperspace experiences! I can't wait for these visuals to be accessible through VR. Imagine being in there...</p>
            <br>
            <div class="youtubeVideo">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hlznfXsW0g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>Listen to Android Jones, the man behind Samskara, as he walks you through his vision and predictions for the VR world. He's got some killer insights & great stories. My key takeaway: Soon, artists will rule the world. If you're a curious being, this talk is definitely worth your time! Just put it at speed 1.5x ;)</p>
            <br>
            <div class="imgInText">
                <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/17/albert-camus-the-rebel/"><img src="../img/editions/001/theRebel.png" alt=""></a>
            </div>
            <p>Definitely digging Camus recently. I've never been able to properly express my thoughts on the art of being a rebel... Fortunately, Albert is here and puts it all together with sensitivity, wit, and a clear sense of direction!</p>

            <br>

            <p><span class="Chloe">Chloé</span> - On my side, I discovered ultrarunning a few days ago and have been obsessed with the beauty of this sport. The amount of vulnerability and mental strength of each runner will blow your mind. One thing is sure, ultrarunning brings the best of human performance back to the surface and demonstrates, once again, that we can become limitless beings.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Sacha's Book Recommendation</h3>
            <p>Shattering our notion that we're the "captain in the cockpit" of our mind, this book sums up groundbreaking research on the importance of the unconscious mind, revealing it's powerful effects on the decision-making, our notion of the Self, individuality & success. It expands these implications into education, culture economics, politics & basically every sphere of human activity.</p>

                <div class="imgInTextLongPlacement">
                    <a href=""><img src="../img/editions/001/socialAnimal.png" alt=""></a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Book: The Social Animal</h4>
            <p>Author: David Brooks</p>
            <p>You'll recognize yourself and find explanations for many of your patterns, thought & behaviours in this revolutionary book. You'll learn about yourself, while expanding your knowledge with new discoveries in neuroscience, sociology, psychology and related fields. </p>
            <p>Echoing the format of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Emile, the writing reveals concepts to us through the story of fictional characters, making it eminently relatable.</p>
            <p>Reading this, I got the feeling that what I was reading was of crucial importance. A massive tool for shaping our collective future, based on an accurate & holistic understanding of human beings. I must have highlighted half of the book. It is an ambitious and electric book — a must read for leaders of the future.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Track of the Week</h3>
            <p>Let's initiate the history of this project by a summer night track that also happens to be kinda perfect for these magic mushrooms trips in the forest!</p>
            <div class="youtubeVideo">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z7033W-8meI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <h4>Track: Sanza Nocturne</h4>
            <p>Album: Psychedelic Samba<br>Artist: Francis Bebey</p>
            <p>First, stop for a second: Isn't that album cover freaking gorgeous?! Gotta love it</p>
            <p>On its side, Sanza Nocturne acts as the opening track of the album, and it delivers big time. After listening to it, you'll most probably catch yourself looking into the horizon with a sense of contemplation. Definitely some soothing jungle vibes right there.</p>
            <p>Also, don't hesitate to give the entire album a listen. Tracks like Sanza Tristesse, Forest Nativity and Guinée bring their fair share of inner emotional movements as well. Enjoy!</p>
            <br>
            <p>All right! This is it for the first edition of the Weekly Dose.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>We Believe in You.</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Lastly, if you want to help one (or five!) of your best friends who are also on the path to become their best selves, send them this weekly dose, they'll be glad you did!</p>
            <p>Have a wonderful day,</p>
