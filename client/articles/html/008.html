            <h3>The dictionary definition: Radiance</h3>
            <p>Light or heat as emitted or reflected by something. Great joy or love, apparent in someone's expression or bearing. A glowing quality of the skin, especially as indicative of good health or youth.</p>
            <h3>The objective:</h3>
            <p>Remove ego layers to allow our spirit to breath, radiate & shine through.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Pursuing Radiance</h3>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> – The Mystery of Radiance</p>
            <p>You might be more acquainted with radiance than you think. The English languages is full of references to it:</p>
            <p>“It’s your time to shine” <br>
                “She’s glowing” <br>
                “He’s beaming with pride” <br>
                “She exudes/radiates confidence” <br>
                “He’s brilliant” <br>
                “She’s a star” <br>
                “He lights up the room”
            </p>
            <p>Depictions of yogis, prophets & saints show them surrounded by light. Steve Jobs had such a noticeable presence that his employees called it a reality-distortion-field. We say of great leaders that they had an aura of power.</p>
            <p>What’s going on here? Could it be that just as we perceive up light & sound from a person, we can perceive emanations from their inner nature? I think so. It doesn’t seem like a stretch to suppose we’re energetically attuned to the inner states of those who surround us. After all, we’re hard-wired social creatures.</p>
            <p>Now, is this just body language we’re picking up? Are we merely creating visual & energetic metaphors to explain macro/micro level body language cues from people? Or is this a real emanation of energy we’re picking up — like tuning in to an energetic field? We’ll leave that question for another time.</p>
            <p><u>The Darkside Of Forced Radiance</u></p>
            <p>One of the biggest issues facing us today is that we take outward signs to be more important than the inner substance. We take the footage to be more important than the experience itself.</p>
            <p>Social media newsfeeds, similarly, are chalk full poorly veiled self-aggrandizement. Any beautiful moment now seems embedded with the imperative to document & share.</p>
            <p>Slowly, the value of the event starts to depend on its appraisal in the eyes of the witnesses. We attach our self-worth to our outward appearance. In response, people have gotten extremely good at simulating outward signs, at the expense of the real shit. “Looking like” becomes more important than being. Believe me, I know. For years I lost sight of myself. Like so many others, I became fixated on the simulacrum to the point of losing the original.</p>
            <p>This is not radiance. This is forced radiance. Simulated radiance. Which is truly a tragedy, because it misses the point or radiance entirely.</p>
            <p>You see the point of radiance… is the experience of radiance. It requires no witness. Radiance is its own reward.</p>
            <p>So why do we fake radiance? Why do we want to be witnessed? To be praised as stars? Why the perverse attachment — not to the inner experience of shining — but to outward appearance?</p>
            <p>Because, deep down, we think that without footage, it’s fiction…</p>
            <p>Every like says “you are loved”.<br>Every mention says “you exist”.<br>Every share says “you belong”.</p>
            <p>How has that been working out for you? It’s been pretty shitty for me. Every time we enjoy one of these shallow dopamine bursts, we invest ourselves more deeply into matters of surface.</p>
            <p>Fuck. That.</p>
            <p><u>True Radiance</u></p>
            <p>I can tell you very little on radiance. I’m just learning to experience its truth myself. What I can tell you from the progress I’ve made so far, is that it’s all about letting go. Letting go of the images which dictate how you should be. Letting down the walls which defend your ego. Divesting from the approval of others. Following your inner truth for its own sake. </p>
            <p>Simply being.</p>
            <p>Doing without forcing. Without expectations on the outcome. Let your inner voice guide you, and you’ll become one with it.</p>
            <p>I leave you with this 24th verse of eternal wisdom from the Tao Te Ching — supreme teachings which provided the bedrock for Buddhism:</p>
            <p>
                <i>He who stands on tiptoe</i> <br>
                <i>doesn't stand firm.</i> <br>
                <i>He who rushes ahead</i> <br>
                <i>doesn't go far.</i> <br>
                <i>He who tries to shine</i> <br>
                <i>dims his own light.</i> <br>
                <i>He who defines himself</i> <br>
                <i>can't know who he really is.</i> <br>
                <i>He who has power over others</i> <br>
                <i>can't empower himself.</i> <br>
                <i>He who clings to his work</i> <br>
                <i>will create nothing that endures.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>If you want to accord with the Tao, <br>just do your job, then let go.</i>

            </p>

            <p>— Shine on you crazy diamonds. Shine on.</p>

            <p><span class="Gregory">Gregory</span> – If you have 1 thing to watch this week, this short documentary must take the winning spot.</p>
            <p>Made in 1978 after going through a life changing LSD experience with her husband, Dorothy nails it down & brings Radiance home. Make yourself tea, & let go.</p>

            <p><span class="Sacha">Sacha</span> - A beautiful soundbite by Alan Watts, accompanied by musical breaths from atmospheric rock band HAELOS.</p>

            <div class="spotifyInTextPlacement">
                <div class="spotifyInText">
                    <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/30p7VKzGMfX9TozycHU2t7" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

            <p>Here's the quote they used in the track:</p>
            <p>“We know that from time to time, there arise among human beings people who seem to exude love as naturally as the sun gives out heat. These people, usually of enormous creative power, are the envy of us all, and, by and large, man’s religions are attempts to cultivate that same power in ordinary people.” — Alan Watts</p>
            <p>To complete Alan’s thought, I’d say that you don’t need the dogma of religion to attain inner radiance. A word of caution, however: spiritual traditions contain great teachings. Don’t let your own dogma be a barrier to them, as I have in the past.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Sacha's Book Recommendation</h3>
            <div class="imgInTextLong">
                <div class="imgInTextLongPlacement">
                    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20173569"><img src="../img/editions/008/taoAudio.png" alt=""></a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p><b>Book:</b> Tao Te Ching <br> <b>Author:</b> Lao Tzu <br> <b>Translator:</b> Stephen Mitchell<p>
            <p>Upon my first listen to this book, in audio format, I fell into a profound bliss. I experienced the most absolute feeling of inner peace in my short life thus far. The teachings have a serene truth to them. With mystical tenderness, it seems to gently draw out the darkness from your soul and fill you with truth.</p>
            <p>If haven’t yet encountered the <i>The Book Of The Way</i>, then it is my honour to bestow this gift upon you. To live in harmony with these 81 verses is to experience true radiance.</p>
            <p>Though many of the verses remain a mystery to me, I sense that I’ll awaken to their truth once I’m ready. Of those that I understand, not one is uncherished.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Track of the Week</h3>
            <p>Back in March, part of the crew went out to see Octave One at a rave. These guys totally incarnate radiance when they play & they allowed us to fly through the night feeling like champions.</p>
            <p>We'd love to share that feeling with you so here's the deal: Close your eyes. Let your heart unclench & start dancing.</p>
            <p>Let yourself be swept into the tide of being.</p>
